MM_DATA_SEGMENT
MM_NO_INIT

%
% mmixal and GNU as on mmixware:
%   The heap will be organized as memory blocks inside the pool
%   segment of the executable. This needs some cooperation from the
%   user: The convention (as defined by the mmixware documentation) is
%   that M_8[:Pool_Segment] points to the first unallocated region
%   within the pool adress space. User programs utilizing address
%   space from the pool segment must obey this rule by 'allocating'
%   memory by modifying M_8[:Pool_Segment] appropriately.
%
% All subroutines come in two variants. The first variant, without a
% trailing 'J', will terminate the program with an error message, the
% second variant (with a trailing 'J'), will jump to :rJ+#4 on succes
% and to :rJ+#0 on failure, and can be used to implement customized
% error handling. An example:
%           % Try to allocate a block of memory:
%           SET         $1,[...]
%           PUSHJ       $0,:MM:Heap:AllocJ
%           JMP         1F
%           [...] % Allocation was successful, continue normally.
%
%    1H     [...] % Allocation failed, error handling.
%
% Subroutines that have at most one argument and one return parameter
% come also in a variant with a trailing 'G' which indicates that
% values are passed through the temporary general register $255. An
% example:
%           % Try to allocate a block of memory:
%           SET         $255,[...]
%           PUSHJ       $255,:MM:Heap:AllocG
%                       % Address of allocated memory in $255
