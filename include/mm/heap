% :MM:Heap:Alloc
%   Allocate a continuous block of memory of size arg0. The returned
%   address is octa aligned (and != #0). If allocation fails, the
%   program is terminated with an error message.

%   arg0 - requested size (in bytes)

%   return value) on failure instead of throwing an error message.
%   Same calling sequence as above.

% :MM:Heap:AllocG

% :MM:Heap:Copy
%   Does an octawise copy of the memory region pointed to by arg0 to

%   min(size(arg0),size(arg1)) bytes. arg0 and arg1 must point to the
%   beginning of valid, not yet freed memory regions previously

% :MM:Heap:Zero
%   This subroutine works on memory regions allocated by Heap:Alloc.
