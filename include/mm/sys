% :MM:Sys:AtExit
% :MM:Sys:AtAbort
% :MM:Sys:AtError
%
% A subroutine can be registered via a call to one of the above
% routines that will be executed at the appropriate event:
%   AtExit  - After invocation of :MM:Sys:Exit
%   AtAbort - After invocation of :MM:Sys:Abort
%   AtError - As an event handler that is invoked if a non fatal (non
%             internal) error condition arises in one of the :MM:
%             subroutines.
%
% The subroutine is called via GO linkage. A return address to the
% corresponding internal library routine is stored in register $0. In
% case of the AtError handler an additional return address is stored
% in $255 pointing to the caller of the library routine.
% Registered subroutines should not make any assumptions on register
% and memory state (except for $0 - and $255 in case of AtError -
% holding a valid return address).
%
% Upon returning, :MM:Sys:Exit and :MM:Sys:Abort will terminate
% the program.
%
% Handler can be reregistered arbitrarily; by specifying #0 the
% current event handler will be removed, in detail:
%
% :MM:Sys:AtExit
% :MM:Sys:AtAbort
%
%   #0000000000000000 - no handler is invoked, program will be
%                       terminated
%   any other address - jump to the specified address via GO linkage
%                       and register $0; after returning, terminate
%                       the program.
%
% :MM:Sys:AtError
%
%   #0000000000000000 - no handler is invoked, program will be
%                       terminated
%   #FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF - print an error message and resume execution
%   any other address - jump to the specified address via GO linkage
%                       and register $0; after returning, resume
%                       execution.
%
% PUSHJ
%   arg0 - address of a subroutine that is registered to be executed
%          at one of the given events
%   no return value
%
% :MM:Sys:AtExitG
% :MM:Sys:AtAbortG
% :MM:Sys:AtErrorG
%   variant of above functions that passes arg0 through general
%   register $255. The value of $255 is preserved.
