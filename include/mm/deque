% :MM:Deque:
%
% This header file sets up a number of assembler macros to set up and
% maintain a double ended queue. The macros internally call allocator and
% deallocator subroutines in :MM:Heap while preserving all (user
% accessible) register contents (with the exception of the specified
% registers that get modified).
%

%
% Deque - double-ended queue
% ==========================
%
%  - "front" and "back" have to be local/global register names. These
%    registers will contain pointers to memory regions of a specified size
%    (when allocated via Deque:PushF, or Deque:PushB). The memory regions
%    are heap allocated, thus the usual operations in :MM:Heap can be
%    applied.
%
%    "front" and "back" must neither be the temporary register $255, nor
%    the (library internal) register :MM:t.
%
%    Note: :MM:Pool:Dealloc and :MM:Pool:Realloc will destory the deque
%    structure - you have to pop the old memory region and push a new one
%    to the deque instead.
%
% Usage example
% """"
%
%           % prepare registers:
%           SET         $0,#0
%           SET         $1,#0
%           % Push two memory regions with a size of 16 bytes:
%           Deque:PushF $0,$1,#10
%           JMP         9F
%           Deque:PushF $0,$1,#10
%           JMP         9F
%           % empty the deque:
% 1H        SWYM
%           Deque:Check $0,$1
%           JMP         2F % deque is empty
%           Deque:PopB  $0,$1
%           JMP         9F

%
% Deque:PushF front, back, size
% Deque:PushB front, back, size
% Deque:PushF_fast front, back
% Deque:PushB_fast front, back
%
%  - Push an element to the deque. size is either a register or an
%    immediate expression specifying the size of the memory region that
%    should be allocated.
%
%    Prerequisite: Before pushing a first entry (either to front or back)
%    the registers front and back have to be nulled (i.e. contain #0).
%
%    Execution continues at @+#8 if successful and at @+#4 on failure.
%
%
% Deque:PopF  front, back
% Deque:PopB  front, back
% Deque:PopF_fast front, back
% Deque:PopB_fast front, back
%
%  - Pop the top (or bottom) most element by deallocating the memory region
%    in question and updating the front and/or back register.
%
%    Execution continues at @+#8 if successful and at @+#4 on failure.
%
%
% Deque:Adv   front, back
% Deque:Rew   front, back
% Deque:Adv_fast front, back
% Deque:Rew_fast front, back
%
%  Internally, the deque is organized as a closed, doubly-linked list
%  (meaning that the next pointer of the last element points to the first
%  elements and vice versa.)
%
%  - Rotate the deque "clockwise" or "counter-clockwise":
%    Deque:Adv advances "front" to the next element (that would have been
%    accessible after a PopF) and sets "back" to "front".
%    Deque:Rew rewinds by setting "front" to "back" and setting "back" to
%    the penultimate element (that would have been accessible after a
%    PopB).
%
%
% Deque:Save  front, back, label
% Deque:Load  front, back, label
%
%  - Save a pointer to the deque to the memory region M8[label].
%
%    Prerequisite: label has to point to an OCTA allocated in the data or
%    pool segment.
%
%    Execution continues at @+#8 if successful and at @+#4 on failure.
%
%
% Deque:Check front, back
%
%  - Execution continues at @+#8 if the registers front, back describe a
%    valid and _non-empty_ deque. Otherwise the deque is considered to be
%    empty and execution continues at @+#4.
