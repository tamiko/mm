% :MM:DataSegment: (for mmixal assembler only)
%
% Explicitly assemble internal data structures at @.
%
% The :MM: library has to assemble some internal data structures into
% the data segment address space. With the (rather simplistic)
% assembler mmixal this needs some cooperation from the user of the
% library to avoid address clashes:
%
% By inclusion of an arbitrary header file of the :MM: library all
% internal data structures are assembled into the :Data_Segment
% starting at address :Data_Segment + #1100000000000000.
%
% If this behaviour is not desired, explicit inclusion of this header
% file overrides this behaviour by assembling all internal data
% structures at the current location @. @ shall reside inside the data
% segment for this purpose. Example:
%        LOC     :Data_Segment
%   [...] % assembly of user data
%   #include "mm/data_segment.mmh"
%   [...]
%        LOC     ...
